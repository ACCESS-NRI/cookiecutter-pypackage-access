## Cliff Notes

- All files related to our template are in the [{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}](https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/cookiecutter-pypackage-access/tree/main/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.project_slug%7D%7D) directory.
- The `{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}` directory will become the root of the created repository.
- Everything is templated with Jinja.
